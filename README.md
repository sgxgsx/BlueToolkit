BlueToolkit is an extensible Bluetooth Classic vulnerability testing framework that helps uncover new and old vulnerabilities in Bluetooth-enabled devices. 

It works by executing templated exploits one by one and verifying appropriate properties based on the template logic. The toolkit is extensible and allows new research to be added to the centralized testing toolkit. 
There are 43 Bluetooth exploits available in the toolkit, from known public exploits and tools to custom-developed ones. 

The framework works in a Black-box fashion, but it is also possible to operate the toolkit in a Gray-box fashion. For that one needs to extend the framework and connect it to the Operating System of the target so that it would be possible to observe Bluetooth logs and guarantee no false positives. 

Also, we have already used our framework and were able to find [64 new vulnerabilities](#results) in 22 cars (Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Mini, Opel, Polestar, Renault, Skoda, Toyota, VW, Tesla).

We have a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/sgxgsx) that provides various types of vulnerability templates. 

In addition to that, you can use MAP Account hijack attack to [elevate privileges](https://github.com/sgxgsx/mapAccountHijack) for the already established connections or as a chain in MitM and DoS attacks.

# Install BlueToolkit

BlueToolkit has 2 installation stages: general and specific module installation.
The general installation downloads the code, modules and tools available in the toolkit and tries to set up modules that do not require human interaction. The specific module installation requires a human to verify that the needed hardware is connected to the device on which the toolkit is being installed. 

## Install
We provide 2 installation options: virtual machine or Ubuntu/Debian.

<details>
  <summary>VM Installation</summary>
  
  Prerequisites:  
  * Virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org
  * vagrant https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/sgxgsx/BlueToolkit --recurse-submodules
  cd BlueToolkit/vagrant
  vagrant up
  ```

After Installation:
* You need to allow the virtual machine to access the Bluetooth module or additional hardware through USB, which requires you to do the following:
* USB support is already switched on, that's why open VirtualBox
* Find a running virtual machine and click on "Show"
* Click on "Devices" -> "USB"
* You will be presented with multiple devices that you can switch on for the virtual machine
* Tick any device that you need (Bluetooth module, hardware, phone) or tick all devices to be sure.


</details>
<details>
  <summary>Ubuntu/Debian Installation</summary>
  Installation:

  ```sh
  sudo mkdir /usr/share/BlueToolkit
  sudo chown $USER:$USER /usr/share/BlueToolkit
  git clone https://github.com/sgxgsx/BlueToolkit /usr/share/BlueToolkit --recurse-submodules
  chmod +x /usr/share/BlueToolkit/install.sh
  /usr/share/BlueToolkit/install.sh
  ```

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Windows and MacOS Installation</summary>
  You could try to install the toolkit on WSL or MacOS directly. 
  Alternatively, use the VM installation option.
</details>



### Specific Module Install

<details>
  <summary>Virtual Machine</summary>
  
  * Verify that the hardware is connected to the machine
  * Verify that you allowed the hardware to be shown to the VM in the USB settings
  * Then depending on the hardware that you need to install do the following:
  
  ```sh
  vagrant ssh
  cd /usr/share/BlueToolkit/installation/
  ls -al
  ```
  
  * Find a script for your hardware and execute it
  ```sh
  ./{HARDWARE}_installation.sh
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Linux</summary>
  
  * Verify that the hardware is connected to the machine
  * Then depending on the hardware that you need to install do the following:
  
  ```sh
  cd /usr/share/BlueToolkit/installation/
  ls -la
  ```
  
  *  Then find a script for your hardware and execute it
  ```sh
  ./{HARDWARE}_installation.sh
  ```
</details>


### Usage

```sh
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH bluekit -h
```

This will display help information for the tool. Here are all the parameters it supports.


```console

# Available Bluetooth Vulnerabilities and Attacks

BlueToolkit automatically downloads all vulnerability and hardware templates. [**BlueToolkit templates**](https://github.com/sgxgsx/templates) repository provides a full list of ready-to-use templates.
Additionally, you can write your own templates and checks as well as add new hardware by following BlueToolkit's [templating guide](https://github.com/sgxgsx/Bluetoolkit/wiki/Templating)
The YAML reference syntax is available [here](https://github.com/sgxgsx/BlueToolkit/wiki/YAMLreference)

We collected and classified Bluetooth vulnerabilities in an "Awesome Bluetooth Security" way. We used the following sources - ACM, IEEE SP, Blackhat, DEFCON, Car Hacking Village, NDSS, and Google Scholars. Looked for the following keywords in Search Engines such as Google, Baidu, Yandex, Bing - Bluetooth security toolkit, Bluetooth exploits github, Bluetooth security framework, bluetooth pentesting toolkit. We also parsed all Github repositories based on the following parameters - topic:bluetooth topic:exploit, topic:bluetooth topic:security.

### Currently BlueToolkit check the following vulnerabilities and attacks:

## Novel Attacks

#### Insecure NC Implementation

The IVI system does not properly implement the Numeric Comparison authentication protocol as in the core specification of the Bluetooth which makes a link to be non-authenticated and thus vulnerable to the NiNo, Method Confusion and custom MitM attacks.

There are 3 possible variations:
1. The IVI/device doesn't require a confirmation for pairing (e.g. no button to confirm the pairing) (Renault, Hyundai cars)
2. The static number is always shown. (BMW, Mini cars)
3. The IVI shows a pairing window without a pairing number to compare. (Audi)

There are 2 possible reasons:
1. State problem
2. Design problem

In case of the state problem an adversary needs to connect to the IVI(other device) with a capability other than DisplayYesNo and the IVI should try to execute a broken Numeric Comparison and not Passkey or Just Works.

In case of a design problem, one simply needs to observe the pairing process and what is required of a used on a target device (IVI).

#### Vehicular NiNo
The vehicle allows connections to a device with no input or output capabilities. According to the specification if one of the devices has a NoInputNoOutput capability, then the pairing mode used is named Just Works and such a link should be considered unauthenticated and vulnerable to MitM attacks. This results in an adjacent adversary being able to execute a practical attack and establish a MitM position.

Important distinction: In this case, the vehicle doesn't allow NoInputNoOutput devices to initiate a connection to the IVI, but fails to check the same for a connection initiated by the IVI. The attack window is smaller than in a usual NiNo attack but still exists.


Note on NiNo devices in the vehicular domain:
In the vehicular domain, the usage of NiNo devices such as headphones is not frequent if legal at all while driving. When it comes to the smartphone domain a connection to such devices is considered a feature and a usability trade-off to enable wireless headphones for example. As such a use-case is not present in the vehicular domain then it's better to disallow connection from such devices, which many of the manufacturers do already.


For the PoC steps please consult [contact extractor documentation](https://github.com/sgxgsx/BlueToolkit/wiki/Manual-Exploits)

#### Contact Extractor attack

The vehicle IVI system allows a physical adversary to extract previously shared through Bluetooth contacts. This happens due to incorrect handling of access control for newly created BT sessions for already known MAC addresses.

## Hardware

To test all vulnerabilities one would need to buy additional hardware:

* ESP-WROVER-KIT-VE for Braktooth vulnerabilities
* Nexus5 (phone) for Internalblue-based vulnerabilities. It also could be substituted by CYW20735, but an additional hardware profile would be needed and 2 exploits won't be reproducible.
* CYW920819M2EVB-01 for BIAS, BLUR and BLUFFS attacks

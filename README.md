BlueToolkit is an extensible Bluetooth Classic vulnerability testing framework that helps uncover new and old vulnerabilities in Bluetooth-enabled devices. 

It works by executing templated exploits one by one and verifying appropriate properties based on the template logic. The toolkit is extensible and allows new research to be added to the centralized testing toolkit. 
There are 43 Bluetooth exploits available in the toolkit, from known public exploits and tools to custom-developed ones. 

The framework works in a Black-box fashion, but it is also possible to operate the toolkit in a Gray-box fashion. For that one needs to extend the framework and connect it to the Operating System of the target so that it would be possible to observe Bluetooth logs and guarantee no false positives. 

Also, we have already used our framework and were able to find [64 new vulnerabilities](#results) in 22 products.

We have a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/sgxgsx) that provides various types of vulnerability templates.

# Install BlueToolkit

BlueToolkit has 2 installation stages: general and specific module installation.
The general installation downloads the code, modules and tools available in the toolkit and tries to set up modules that do not require human interaction. The specific module installation requires a human to verify that the needed hardware is connected to the device on which the toolkit is being installed. 

## Install
We provide 2 installation options: virtual machine or Ubuntu/Debian.

<details>
  <summary>VM Installation</summary>
  
  Prerequisites:  
  * Virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org
  * vagrant https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/sgxgsx/BlueToolkit --recurse-submodules
  cd BlueToolkit/vagrant
  vagrant up
  ```

After Installation:
* You need to allow the virtual machine to access the Bluetooth module or additional hardware through USB, which requires you to do the following:
* USB support is already switched on, that's why open VirtualBox
* Find a running virtual machine and click on "Show"
* Click on "Devices" -> "USB"
* You will be presented with multiple devices that you can switch on for the virtual machine
* Tick any device that you need (Bluetooth module, hardware, phone) or tick all devices to be sure.


</details>
<details>
  <summary>Ubuntu/Debian Installation</summary>
  Installation:

  ```sh
  sudo mkdir /usr/share/BlueToolkit
  sudo chown $USER:$USER /usr/share/BlueToolkit
  git clone https://github.com/sgxgsx/BlueToolkit /usr/share/BlueToolkit --recurse-submodules
  chmod +x /usr/share/BlueToolkit/install.sh
  /usr/share/BlueToolkit/install.sh
  ```

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Windows and MacOS Installation</summary>
  You could try to install the toolkit on WSL or MacOS directly. 
  Alternatively, use the VM installation option.
</details>



### Specific Module Install

<details>
  <summary>Virtual Machine</summary>
  
  * Verify that the hardware is connected to the machine
  * Verify that you allowed the hardware to be shown to the VM in the USB settings
  * Then depending on the hardware that you need to install do the following:
  
  ```sh
  vagrant ssh
  cd /usr/share/BlueToolkit/installation/
  ls -al
  ```
  
  * Find a script for your hardware and execute it
  ```sh
  ./{HARDWARE}_installation.sh
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Linux</summary>
  
  * Verify that the hardware is connected to the machine
  * Then depending on the hardware that you need to install do the following:
  
  ```sh
  cd /usr/share/BlueToolkit/installation/
  ls -la
  ```
  
  *  Then find a script for your hardware and execute it
  ```sh
  ./{HARDWARE}_installation.sh
  ```
</details>


### Usage

```sh
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH bluekit -h
```

This will display help information for the tool. Here are all the parameters it supports.


```console
usage: bluekit [-h] [-t TARGET] [-l] [-c] [-ct] [-ch] [-v VERBOSITY] [-ex EXCLUDEEXPLOITS [EXCLUDEEXPLOITS ...]] [-e EXPLOITS [EXPLOITS ...]] [-r] [-re] [-rej] [-hh HARDWARE [HARDWARE ...]] ...

positional arguments:
  rest

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        target MAC address
  -l, --listexploits    List exploits or not
  -c, --checksetup      Check whether Braktooth is available and setup
  -ct, --checktarget    Check connectivity and availability of the target
  -ch, --checkpoint     Start from a checkpoint
  -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity VERBOSITY
                        Verbosity level
  -ex EXCLUDEEXPLOITS [EXCLUDEEXPLOITS ...], --excludeexploits EXCLUDEEXPLOITS [EXCLUDEEXPLOITS ...]
                        Exclude exploits, example --exclude exploit1, exploit2
  -e EXPLOITS [EXPLOITS ...], --exploits EXPLOITS [EXPLOITS ...]
                        Scan only for provided --exploits exploit1, exploit2; --exclude is not taken into account
  -r, --recon           Run a recon script
  -re, --report         Create a report for a target device
  -rej, --reportjson    Create a report for a target device
  -hh HARDWARE [HARDWARE ...], --hardware HARDWARE [HARDWARE ...]
                        Scan only for provided exploits based on hardware --hardware hardware1 hardware2; --exclude and --exploit are not taken into account

EXAMPLES:
Run bluekit recon:
   $ sudo -E env PATH=$PATH bluekit -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -r

Run bluekit connectivity check:
   $ sudo -E env PATH=$PATH bluekit -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -ct

Run bluekit with a specific exploit:
   $ sudo -E env PATH=$PATH bluekit -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -e invalid_max_slot

Run bluekit with specific exploits:
   $ sudo -E env PATH=$PATH bluekit -t AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF -e invalid_max_slot au_rand_flooding internalblue_knob

Run bluekit and list all available exploits:
   $ sudo -E env PATH=$PATH bluekit -l

# Available Bluetooth Vulnerabilities and Attacks

BlueToolkit automatically downloads all vulnerability and hardware templates. [**BlueToolkit templates**](https://github.com/sgxgsx/templates) repository provides a full list of ready-to-use templates.
Additionally, you can write your own templates and checks as well as add new hardware by following BlueToolkit's [templating guide](https://github.com/sgxgsx/Bluetoolkit/wiki/Templating)
The YAML reference syntax is available [here](https://github.com/sgxgsx/BlueToolkit/wiki/YAMLreference)

We collected and classified Bluetooth vulnerabilities in an "Awesome Bluetooth Security" way. We used the following sources - ACM, IEEE SP, Blackhat, DEFCON, Car Hacking Village, NDSS, and Google Scholars. Looked for the following keywords in Search Engines such as Google, Baidu, Yandex, Bing - Bluetooth security toolkit, Bluetooth exploits github, Bluetooth security framework, bluetooth pentesting toolkit. We also parsed all Github repositories based on the following parameters - topic:bluetooth topic:exploit, topic:bluetooth topic:security.

### Currently BlueToolkit check the following vulnerabilities and attacks:

For manual attacks refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/sgxgsx/BluetToolkit/wiki/Manual-Exploits).

## Results from testing

We tested XXXXXXX from the following manufacturers and were able to find 60+ new vulnerabilities in them:

** Scheduled for August 2024 **

## Hardware

To test all vulnerabilities one would need to buy additional hardware:

* ESP-WROVER-KIT-VE for Braktooth vulnerabilities
* Nexus5 (phone) for Internalblue-based vulnerabilities. It also could be substituted by CYW20735, but an additional hardware profile would be needed and 2 exploits won't be reproducible.
* CYW920819M2EVB-01 for BIAS, BLUR and BLUFFS attacks
